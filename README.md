# Introduction-to-CSS
I am studying the Udemy Course "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp"!
The course is, in my opinion, straightforward, well-explained, and easy  to understand.

This repository reflects all of my assignments from Section 5: Introduction to CSS combined into one website for easier observation (and a less cluttered collection of repos for me). Feel free to explore the site!
